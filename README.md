This repository contains stuff for Thomas, or by Thomas.

## 27/01/2018 
For homework this week Thomas needs to start learning how to tell the time on a clock. Thomas needs to be able to recognise o'clock, quarter past, half past and quarter to. This clock will generate a random time (limited to o'clock, quarter past, half past and quarter to). Thomas will be required to provide 10 correct answers to earn 5 minutes of xbox/tv/ipad!
